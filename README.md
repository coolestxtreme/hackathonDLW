# hackathonDLW

Hi all! 

We are Team Playmade, submitting our code for the deep learning week hackathon. 
Our project involves image classification, we attached the code for the convultional neural network that we have implemented. This image classification model will be the background for the glasses that people who are visually-impaired in the community can use, to better idetify things that are in front of themselves. This smart-glasses will output the object in the form of a voice command to let the visually impaired know..

However, as it is relatively untrained, we decided to use the yolov5l pre-trained model on the images, as the time for this hackathon is quite limited.
